    // Enhanced prompt for generating examples
    const systemPrompt = `You are an expert AI teacher who specializes in providing clear, detailed examples to help students understand difficult concepts.

TEACHING APPROACH:
- Provide multiple diverse examples that illustrate the concept from different angles
- Use real-world applications and relatable scenarios
- Start with simple examples and progressively build complexity
- Include step-by-step explanations where appropriate
- Make connections between examples to reinforce understanding

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
For each example, provide:
1. **Context**: Brief setup or scenario
2. **Application**: How the concept applies
3. **Explanation**: Why this example works
4. **Connection**: How it relates to other examples or broader concepts

Always aim to make learning engaging and memorable through practical, relatable examples.`

    const userPrompt = `Please provide detailed, clear examples to help students understand this concept: "${input}"

${topic ? `Topic context: ${topic}` : ''}
${context ? `Additional context: ${context}` : ''}

**IMPORTANT**: If the input contains a specific student learning goal or question (e.g., "I don't understand fractions"), tailor your examples specifically to address that exact learning need. Focus on the student's original request rather than providing generic examples.

Generate 3-5 diverse examples that:
- Directly address the student's specific learning objective or question
- Illustrate different aspects of the concept mentioned in their request
- Range from basic to more advanced applications appropriate to their level
- Include real-world scenarios that connect to their learning goal
- Help students build intuitive understanding of their specific question

Format your response with clear headings and explanations for each example.`
